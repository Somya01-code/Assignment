    "1. DEADLOCKS: A deadlock is a concurrency failure mode where a thread wait for a condition that never occurs. The result is that the deadlock threads are unable to progress and the program is stuck or frozen and must be terminated forcefully. Common examples of cause of deadloacks are :\n",
    "- Thread that waits for same object twice\n",
    "- Threads that wait of each other\n",
    "- Thread that fail to release resources\n",
    "2. RACE CONDITIONS: A race condition is a situation that develops when many threads share a resource or execute the same piece of code in a multithreaded context. Inappropriate handling of this might result in an unfavorable scenario where the output state depends on the threads execution order.\n",
    "3. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEADLOCK AND RACE CONDITION: A race condition occurs when two threads use the same variable at a given time. Deadlock exists when two threads seek one lock simultaneously."
